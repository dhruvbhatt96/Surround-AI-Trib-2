# Surround: -

Surround provides framework for machine learning pipelines in Python. Surround designed to be easy to use, flexible, and to help data scientists. 
Surround is designed to solve problems faced by data scientists such as same changes required again and again so for that data scientists has to write code again while using surround can solve it. 
Surround provides a flexible way to use machine learning pipelines without using C/C++.
We can use it with existing intelligent api like Google cloud services, AWS Rekognition.
